-Final Android project-

An Android app that serves as a travel blog where users can share their trips from different destinations around the world by uploading a photo and description.
They can add recommendations / ways to contact the same user, with the recommended place. 
In addition, the various users will be able to manage a personal profile by selecting an image and a name that will appear above the experience they uploaded,
as well as the various users will be able to search for recommendations according to a particular continent.

<p dir="auto">In this project we chose to use the <strong>MVVM architecture</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">We have the View layer that is responsible for the presentation, for example the
input from the user. The View is also responsible for producing the graphics and has the code-
behind - for example, functions that are activated when we press a button, which are called
event-oriented programming.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Model</strong> – Responsible for our business logic, such as algorithms and data access.</li>
<li><strong>View Model</strong> – It passes commands from the View to the Model, and its purpose is to
separate the View from the Model.</li>
<li><strong>Data Binding</strong> – We can wrap variables such as those in the View, and then when we change
something in the text, it will automatically changed in the ViewModel.</li>
</ul>
